    ---------------------------------
    If a functionality is DEPRECATED, you can know it by DEPRECATED warnings
    except for attribute method.
    You can check all DEPRECATED functionalities by document.
    DEPRECATED functionality is removed after five years,
    but if at least one person use the functionality and tell me that thing
    I extend one year each time he tell me it.

    EXPERIMENTAL functionality will be changed without warnings.
